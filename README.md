JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

## Description

This project was designed to create a website that can generate a random password for users. Now this website can be used for an easier way to come up with a password when you have ran out of passwords that are creative, meet password criteria, and are strong passwords to prevent hacking. Essentially this website solves the problem that many users have which is creating a unique password for all media or websites that require passwords. Through this project I learned how to properly use arrays, how to change arrays to strings, how to display an array without commas, and how to display arrays to the screen.

## How to Contribute

This project is complete. Contributors could join and help display the password on the screen rather than an alert, either way works but it is another feature that could work.
